# Production-Parts-Monitoring

The script for following the current process step of production parts (stators and rotors) by Google Apps Script. 

-  checking the control card (google sheets) and fulfillment of different fields (only on-going parts without rejected and finished ones)
-  putting the references of parts along with process to be done in Production-Monitoring file

A great help for Production Management Team.
